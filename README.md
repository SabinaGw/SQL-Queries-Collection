## Introduction

As a data analyst, I have extensive experience in data extraction, transformation, and analysis. This repository includes a selection of SQL queries developed to tackle various data-related tasks, from simple data retrieval to complex data transformations and performance enhancements.

## Queries

- `2024_Annual_Employee_Average.sql`: In this query, I calculate the average number of employees in 2024 for each company location. Based on the result, key metrics will be calculated which are essential for planning the budget for 2025.
- `ranking-query.sql`: This query is designed to prepare executive reports. It presents the ranking of employee salaries by profession and location within a healthcare organization dedicated to supporting children with disabilities. The organization operates departments in three major cities in the USA, providing a detailed comparison of salaries across different professions and locations.
- `most_frequent_clinic_visitors_by_department.sql`: This script identifies patients who most frequently visit specific departments of a healthcare clinic, enabling management to align the medical team and the number of therapists with the highest patient needs in each department.
