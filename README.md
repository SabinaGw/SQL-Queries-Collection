## Introduction

As an analyst working in a finance company, I have experience in data extraction, transformation, and analysis. This repository includes some of the SQL queries I’ve worked on, ranging from basic data retrieval to practical data tasks.

## Queries

- `Monthly_Department_Performance_2024.sql`:This SQL script calculates month-over-month changes in the quantity of visits and revenue within each department for the year 2024. It uses CTEs to combine summary data and provide insights into trends and percentage changes.
- `2024_Annual_Employee_Average.sql`: In this query, I calculate the average number of employees in 2024 for each company location. Based on the result, key metrics will be calculated which are essential for planning the budget for 2025.
- `ranking-query.sql`: This query is designed to prepare executive reports. It presents the ranking of employee salaries by profession and location within a healthcare organization dedicated to supporting children with disabilities. The organization operates departments in three major cities in the USA, providing a detailed comparison of salaries across different professions and locations.
- `most_frequent_clinic_visitors_by_department.sql`: This script identifies patients who most frequently visit specific departments of a healthcare clinic, enabling management to align the medical team and the number of therapists with the highest patient needs in each department.
